# Heavy Metal Prediction and Analysis Tool

This project is a simple AI-inspired web tool built with React that predicts the concentration of heavy metals in soil samples based on user input.

### 🌱 What It Does:
- Predicts the levels of **Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn** in soil.
- Takes inputs like:
  - Organic Matter (%)
  - Soil pH
  - Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)
- Displays results in beautiful charts using Recharts.

### ⚙️ Built With:
- React (JavaScript)
- Recharts for graphing
- Hosted on Vercel

### 🚀 How to Use:
1. Enter your soil data into the form.
2. Click "Predict".
3. View the predicted metal levels in the chart below.

### 💡 Why This Project?
This tool helps researchers, farmers, and students visualize potential soil contamination in a simple and interactive way.
